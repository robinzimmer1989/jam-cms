## Editor

There are a lot of reasons why you should use jamCMS. Here are the most important one’s from a editor’s perspective.

- Live editing: See how content changes look in realtime. Don’t worry about preview functionality anymore.
- Better editing: The entire content – including, header, footer and menus – can be edited within the editor so you can see exactly how it will look like.
- Unbreakable: Clients can’t add plugins or unsupported features to the site and potentially breaking it.
- Lightning Speed: Content editing is fast and navigating to a different page doesn't require a full reload, thanks to the use of React.
- Share previews: You wanna share a new page with the exectutive team first before pubishing it? No problem, you can send preview links (with optional expiry date) to external people.
- Private pages: Ever tried to add private pages to a Gatsby site? Let's just say it's not that easy. With jamCMS those are supported out of the box... for any content type.
- Easy to use: Your clients already know how to use jamCMS because of the WordPress familiar user interface.

## Developer

- Optimized workflow: Define post types, templates and fields within a simple JavaScript object and jamCMS automatically syncs those with WordPress.
- Fast Development: Everything is already set up and the developer can focus on what’s really important, the frontend.
- No Risk: The plugin integrates seamlessly with a regular WordPress-Gatsby setup and can be decoupled at any time. If a feature is not supported (yet), simply edit the content via WordPress interface. Oh and WordPress previews are finally working!
- WordPress ecosystem: You can still use all backend WP plugins as usual (i.e. WP All Import)
