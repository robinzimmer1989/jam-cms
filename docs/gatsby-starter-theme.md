# Gatsby Starter Theme

The easiest way to get started is using the [TailwindCSS starter theme](https://github.com/robinzimmer1989/jam-cms/tree/master/jam-cms-starter-tailwind).

Once downloaded, create a .env.development file in the root directory with the following variables. Check out [Get Started](https://github.com/robinzimmer1989/jam-cms/blob/master/docs/get-started.md) for details.

```
GATSBY_JAM_CMS_URL=YOUR_WP_URL
GATSBY_JAM_CMS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

If everything is set up you can run `yarn && gatsby develop`. When you navigate to `http:localhost:8000/jam-cms` you can log in with your WordPress credentials.
